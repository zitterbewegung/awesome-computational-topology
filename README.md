Resources and Software for Computational Topology [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
## Software
- SnapPy https://www.math.uic.edu/t3m/SnapPy/index.html (SnapPy is a program for studying the topology and geometry of 3-manifolds, with a focus on hyperbolic structures. )
- rManifolds a software package that generates random links and braids (note I'm having trouble executing this persons code and if i get it to work I will add a new link to my branch. https://github.com/mauriciogtec/rManifolds/
- PHCpack: a general-purpose solver 
for polynomial systems by homotopy continuation http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/PHCpack/phcpack.html
- PHYJuypter An interface for Juypter for PHCPack https://github.com/JazzTap/phcjupyter
